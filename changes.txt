-----------------------------

NEW:

Added Scramble mode! This is similar to Lego's old 8 - 10 weapons buckshot mode. You get 3 random weapons and a rune.
It is compatible with any game mode, enabling it only stops the weapons from appearing. Enable buckshot to disable health and weapon energy.
Set dirp_scramble to 1 to activate. Set dirp_scrambletime to how often (in seconds) you want the weapons to change.

Added some old OpenGL dynamic light defs I had lying around. (Also added new ones for v4 of MM8BDM.)
As a result of the above, I stuck the old halloween lights script in. Same CVAR as before. (You have to set halloween_lights to 0 to enable, silly but consistancy is important...)
Added a weapon help system. Bind "wephelp" to a button to use it.
Added Rune Icons
Added MAGICAL MYSTERY MUSIC!!

----------------------------

CHANGES:

Runes are no longer given in LMS.
Eddie now respects dirp_allweps
LMS was broken because it tried to use the old cvar. 10/10 go me.
All weapons have proper slot numbers. Some of them are a bit weird due to the nature of the weapons, though.
