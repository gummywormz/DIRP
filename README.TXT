Title                   : Drown In Robot Parts

Description             : D.I.R.P v4a is a weapon pack for MM8BDM designed
                          to be as chaotic as possible. It features 145 new
                          weapons and 5 new items. The weapons are randomly
                          replaced within the maps. The LMS randomizer has
                          also been tweaked to give you the new weapons.
                          You can use the server variable "dirp_AllWeps" to
                          change whether you want to see only D.I.R.P
                          weapons or both the base weapons and the D.I.R.P
                          weapons.

Additional Credits to   : Classes team for some sprites and sounds. Lego,

                          people for some of the code I based some weapons
                          off of. Bluebrawl, FGG, SaviorSword, LlamaHombre
                          and probably some others too for giving ideas in
                          ye olde community weapon project / topic.
